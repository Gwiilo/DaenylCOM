# Boids Simulation

A dynamic particle system demonstrating flocking behavior with Three.js. This simulation showcases emergent behavior through simple rules:

- **Separation**: Boids avoid crowding local flockmates
- **Alignment**: Boids steer towards the average heading of neighbors  
- **Cohesion**: Boids steer towards the average position of neighbors

The result is a mesmerizing display of artificial life that responds to mouse interaction and creates beautiful, organic movement patterns.
