# Physics Simulation

An interactive physics playground featuring realistic physics simulation with Three.js. This demo includes:

- **Interactive Objects**: Click and drag spheres, cubes, and soft-body jelly beans
- **Realistic Physics**: Gravity, collision detection, and material properties
- **Cutting Tool**: Slice objects into pieces with realistic physics
- **Multiple Body Types**: Rigid bodies (sphere, cube) and soft bodies (jelly bean)
- **Visual Effects**: Realistic lighting, shadows, and materials

## Controls
- **Left Click + Drag**: Move objects around
- **Right Click**: Activate cutting tool
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom camera
- **Space**: Reset scene

## Features
- Real-time physics simulation
- Dynamic object creation and destruction
- Soft body deformation
- Material-based interactions
